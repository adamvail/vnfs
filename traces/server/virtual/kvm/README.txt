Traces run on the server (Adam's macbook) from a KVM VM on a desktop with NAT and bridged networking. As expected, when bridged the KVM MAC address came through to the server. 
When NAT'd, even though it wouldn't mount, we see that it was the desktop's normal MAC address that came through. All results were expected.
