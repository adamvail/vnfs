The traces of VMware VMs were done on Adam's desktop to macbook. The desktop was running VMware player with an ubunut VM. There are files for both NAT and bridge.

The NAT shows that the VM's packets are rewritten to have the same IP and MAC addresses as the host system.

The bridge traces show that the server sees packets that have the IP address associated with the bridged VM and more importantly, it has a generic VMware MAC address.

So, hopefully in a bridged setting we can always filter VM communications on the MAC address.
